# COVEN-CORE
COVEN (Composable Operations for Versatile Exploration Networks) is a ROS 2-based modular robotics framework enabling autonomous dock-and-rover swarms with standardized mechanical, electrical, and data interfaces. Phase 1 validates full plug-level lifecycle logic—connect, verify, operate, and return—in simulation before fabrication.
